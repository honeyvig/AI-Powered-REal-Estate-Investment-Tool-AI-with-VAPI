# AI-Powered-REal-Estate-Investment-Tool-AI-with-VAPIMarket: real estate investing
Looking for an AI integration that can dial multiple leads per day, answer inbound calls when human agents are unavailable, and possibly integrate and update and/or transfer leads via integration within 3d party Podio Citrix CRM once once interested.
Is this something you can do on vapi?
=======================
AI-powered real estate investment tool that dials leads, answers inbound calls when human agents are unavailable, and integrates with your CRM (like Podio) using VAPI or similar tools. To achieve this, you'll need to:

    Dialing Multiple Leads: Use a tool like Twilio for automated outbound calling. Twilio can make multiple calls at once and help you build interactive voice response (IVR) systems to handle inbound calls.

    Inbound Call Handling: Use a Voice AI solution to handle incoming calls. This can include basic information gathering, lead qualification, or transferring the call to a human agent if necessary.

    CRM Integration: Podio has an API that allows you to add or update leads directly from your AI system. You'll use this API to automatically update lead information or transfer leads to your Podio CRM.

    VAPI: VAPI (Voice API) can help you integrate voice systems into your solution. If you're looking for custom voice AI interactions, tools like Twilio and Dialogflow are alternatives for voice-based interactions.

Solution Outline

Here's a Python-based solution using Twilio, Dialogflow, and Podio API for managing leads. This example will demonstrate how to dial multiple leads, answer inbound calls with voice AI, and integrate lead data with Podio.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, you need to install the necessary libraries:

pip install twilio google-cloud-dialogflow podio-py flask

Step 2: Set Up Twilio and Dialogflow

    Twilio: Set up a Twilio account and get your API keys. You’ll need to use Twilio's Programmable Voice API to dial leads and handle inbound calls.

    Dialogflow: Create a Dialogflow agent to handle inbound calls. This can be used for lead qualification and routing.

    Podio: Create a Podio account, and generate an API key for integrating lead data with your CRM.

Step 3: Python Backend for Outbound Calls and Inbound Call Handling
1. Outbound Calls to Multiple Leads

This section uses Twilio to dial multiple leads.

from twilio.rest import Client
import time

# Twilio credentials
account_sid = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
twilio_phone_number = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

def dial_leads(lead_numbers):
    for number in lead_numbers:
        call = client.calls.create(
            to=number,
            from_=twilio_phone_number,
            url='http://your-ngrok-url/call-handler'  # URL to handle the call (e.g., a webhook)
        )
        print(f"Dialing {number}: Call SID {call.sid}")
        time.sleep(2)  # Optional: Add delay between calls

# Example lead numbers (in real-world scenario, these would be fetched from your CRM or database)
lead_numbers = ['+1234567890', '+1987654321', '+1122334455']
dial_leads(lead_numbers)

2. Handling Inbound Calls with Voice AI

This example uses Dialogflow to answer calls when a human agent isn't available. Dialogflow is used for natural language processing to understand the caller’s responses and route them accordingly.

from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse
from flask import Flask, request
import dialogflow
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Dialogflow settings
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID = 'your_dialogflow_project_id'
SESSION_ID = 'unique_session_id'

def detect_intent_texts(project_id, session_id, text):
    session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
    session = session_client.session_path(project_id, session_id)

    text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(text=text, language_code="en")
    query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)

    response = session_client.detect_intent(session=session, query_input=query_input)

    return response.query_result.fulfillment_text

@app.route("/call-handler", methods=['POST'])
def call_handler():
    response = VoiceResponse()

    # Start a conversation with Dialogflow
    response.say("Hello, this is an automated assistant. Please tell me how I can help you.", voice='alice')

    # Gather the caller's response and send it to Dialogflow for processing
    gather = response.gather(input_type='speech', action='/handle-response')
    gather.say("Please speak your inquiry.")

    return str(response)

@app.route("/handle-response", methods=['POST'])
def handle_response():
    response = VoiceResponse()

    user_response = request.form['SpeechResult']
    dialogflow_response = detect_intent_texts(GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID, SESSION_ID, user_response)

    if dialogflow_response:
        response.say(dialogflow_response)
    else:
        response.say("Sorry, I didn't understand that. Please try again.")
    
    return str(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 4: Integrating with Podio API

After handling the lead’s information (e.g., name, phone number, response), you can update or create a lead in Podio.

from podio import api

# Podio credentials
podio_client = api.PodioClient(client_id="your_podio_client_id", client_secret="your_podio_client_secret", app_id="your_podio_app_id", app_token="your_podio_app_token")

def create_lead_in_podio(lead_data):
    item_data = {
        'fields': {
            'lead_name': lead_data['name'],
            'lead_phone': lead_data['phone'],
            'lead_inquiry': lead_data['inquiry'],
        }
    }
    
    # Create a new item in Podio's Leads app
    item = podio_client.Item.create(item_data)
    print("Created lead in Podio:", item)

# Example lead data from Dialogflow processing
lead_data = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'phone': '+1234567890',
    'inquiry': 'Interested in buying a property in downtown.'
}

create_lead_in_podio(lead_data)

Step 5: Putting It All Together

    Dialing Leads: The dial_leads function dials multiple leads and triggers an outbound call.
    Handling Inbound Calls: If a lead calls in, the call-handler route handles the call and sends the conversation to Dialogflow.
    CRM Integration: Once a conversation ends, the lead data can be sent to Podio to be stored as a lead.

Step 6: Deploying and Running the Application

    Deploy the Flask app using a server (Heroku, AWS, etc.), and make sure to expose the /call-handler and /handle-response routes to the public internet (you can use ngrok for local testing).

    Set up the Twilio webhook URL in your Twilio dashboard to point to your /call-handler route.

    Integrate Podio API to push lead data to your CRM based on inbound conversations.

Step 7: Optional UI (Chatbot)

If you'd like a chatbot interface, you can use a Next.js or React frontend that allows users to interact with your system and see the lead information in real-time.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates how you can use AI-powered tools like Twilio, Dialogflow, and Podio to automate real estate lead management, including dialing leads, handling inbound calls with voice AI, and storing lead data in a CRM. This setup can be easily scaled to dial multiple leads, answer questions, and automatically update your CRM with the lead’s information.
